# GOSSIP AND PUSHSUM ALGORITHMS - COP5615: Fall 2019

# PROBLEM
The goal of this project is to determine the convergence of Gossip and Pushsum algorithms through a simulator based on actors written in Elixir.

# Steps to run the program:-

1. Download the file and unzip it

2. Run the command: mix run proj2.exs 100 full gossip

3. Topologies: full | line| torus | honeycomb | randHoneycomb| rand2D

4. Algorithm: gossip | push-sum
